//-DONE-------------------------------------

// DONE As a developer, I should be able to run the npm install command to install all of the dependencies for the build process.
 // I think this is automatic. It's install the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

// DONE As a developer, when I run the gulp scripts or gulp styles commands at the command line, source maps are generated for the JavaScript and CSS files respectively.
 // I think this is ot be handled by the scripts and styles commands, not a separate task.

// DONE As a developer, I should be able to run the gulp styles command at the command line to compile the project’s SCSS files into CSS then concatenate and minify into an all.min.css file that is then copied to the dist/styles folder.

// DONE As a developer, I should be able to run the gulp images command at the command line to optimize the size of the project’s JPEG and PNG files, and then copy those optimized images to the dist/content folder.

// DONE As a developer, I should be able to run the gulp clean command at the command line to delete all of the files and folders in the dist folder.

// DONE As a developer, I should be able to run the gulp scripts command at the command line to concatenate, minify, and copy all of the project’s JavaScript files into an all.min.js file that is then copied to the dist/scripts folder.

// DONE As a developer, I should be able to run the gulp build command at the command line to run the clean, scripts, styles, and images tasks with confidence that the clean task completes before the other commands.

// DONE As a developer, I should be able to run the gulp command at the command line to run the build task and serve my project using a local web server.

// DONE Extra Credit
// As a developer, when I run the default gulp command, it should continuously watch for changes to any .scss file in my project. When there is a change to one of the .scss files, the gulp styles command is run and the files are compiled, concatenated, and minified to the dist folder. My project should then reload in the browser, displaying the changes.

//-LESSONS LEARNT--------------------------
// gulpfile.js should always be in the root of the project
// gulp.src tells the Gulp task what files to use for the task

// Taken out as not required with browser-sync
// no other tasks depend on the watch method therefore no return statement is necessary.
// gulp.task("watchFiles", function() {
//   gulp.watch('sass/**/*.scss', ['styles']); // recompile css if a file change is detected
//   //gulp.watch('js/**/*.js', ['minifyScripts']); // recompile js if a file change is detected
// });
// // NOTE browser cache problem. Not automatically showing new styles in browser.
// // NOTE watchFiles isn't working. No automatic recompile.
